# Cryptocurrency-Exchange
This is a project I decided to make randomly because I enjoy programming and I am into crypto.

It took me somewhere between 7 and 9 hours to program, the classes taking most of the time as you have to come up with a way to create them so that the program runs smoothly and it's structured well.

I still need to make it read and write to an xml file that stores the wallets data, and maybe even data on the prices over time which I could try to use with machine learning to predict the price based on rsi and other indicators.

I have just completed my first year of uni, so don't expect this to be the best code ever, but I also did follow some good coding practice from my object oriented programming class, where the final project was a banking system which is more complicated than you could think, so the classes are mostly well done in my opinion

Hopefully to whoever is looking at this, you enjoy looking at what I have created and that you can appreciate the effort I put into it.
